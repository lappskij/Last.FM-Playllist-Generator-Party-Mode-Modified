# Last.FM-Playllist-Generator-Party-Mode-Modified
Would love some help to modify this great addon script by ErlendSB. Found it by google.
This is a great script running in the background on Kodi once you start it in music addons. 
It then search thru Last.FM based upon a song you select from your collection. It finds similar songs and add (by default, 
but can be changed in settings) 3 similar songs found in your music database to the list. When playing next song it finds 
3 new similar songs based on the new title. And so it goes on untill it has filled up a songlist of 250 songs.

PROBLEM: I do NOT program python and have serious issues modifying this script to meet my needs, so I pleed for help from
proggers to modify and finish this awesome idea of a script. As a start, the biggest issue I have is a tiny problem that with
the right knowledge could be worked out in a flash. I have a big karaoke collection on my server and this script does not
differ between regular mp3's and my karaoke mp3's because they are all added to the Kodi database as music. The only difference
that my karaoke has been tagged as Karaoke in Genre. This script does not have an exception for the genre karaoke. 

1. Can someone please help me with the database query so that this script will extract ony music MP3s from my collection?

For further COOL features would be to work on with other TAGs like MOOD and OCCASION etc....
